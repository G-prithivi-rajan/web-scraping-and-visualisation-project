# Data Cleaning, Visualization & Web Scraping

This repository contains two projects:

1. **Data Cleaning & Visualization** â€“ A Jupyter Notebook that cleans raw data and creates visualizations to find useful insights.
2. **Web Scraping** â€“ A Python script that collects property data from *MagicBricks* using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`, and saves it into a CSV file for further analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Project 1: Data Cleaning & Visualization

* Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.
* Used **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data preparation.
* Created visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to understand patterns and trends.
* Focused on making data ready for analysis and easy to interpret through charts.

## ðŸ“Œ Project 2: Web Scraping

* Scraped property listings such as **BHK, square feet, price, furnishing, bathrooms, parking, and builder name**.
* Used **Requests** and **BeautifulSoup (bs4)** for extracting HTML data.
* Processed and stored the results in a **CSV file** for later analysis.
* Helps in understanding real estate trends and structured data collection from websites.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Libraries

* **Python**
* **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ data cleaning and processing
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** â€“ data visualization
* **Requests, BeautifulSoup, lxml** â€“ web scraping
* **CSV, OS** â€“ data storage

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

* `data_cleaning_&_visualisation.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook for cleaning and visualization.
* `web scrapping.py` â€“ Python script for scraping property data.
* `property_data.csv` â€“ Output file with scraped property details (generated after running script).
* `README.md` â€“ Project documentation.

## âœ… Conclusion

These projects demonstrate data handling skills, from **cleaning and visualization** to **real-world web scraping**. They show how raw data can be transformed into useful insights and structured datasets.
